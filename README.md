Feedback from professor 3/7/2019


Do not repeat yourself!!
Every function should have one action, if it has more than that you need to 
justify as to why
The code should be easy to identify, and clean. Grammar should be on point.
Grade will be based on how clean you build your code, and how your code is 
executed.
... Classes should be named so that you can use the same code in the future
with all csv files
... html/bag example
